# C-VECTOR

## Overview

C-VECTOR is a simple implementation of dynamic arrays (vectors) in C. This project provides basic vector management operations such as initialisation, insertion, deletion and resizing. It is intended to facilitate the understanding and use of dynamic arrays in C programming.

## Features

- Dynamic sizing: Automatically resize arrays as elements are added or removed.
- Basic operations: Includes operations such as push, pop, insert, delete and access by index.
- Error Handling: Basic error handling for memory allocation errors.
